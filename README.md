http:  data shared with no encryption:

        1. http 1.1 = html , css , js  ||  one by one
        2. http 2.0 = html , css , js  ||   multiplexing || TCP protocol
        3. http 3.0 = html, css , js   ||  same time || QUIC - udp + tcp


https : data + encryption || SSL / TLS certificate - private and public key.

         HTTPS does not make a website 100% secure—it only encrypts the connection, but vulnerabilities in the website’s code can still exist.

proxy and reverse proxy 
     proxy - intermediate device between user and server || forwards with no encryption || vpn - proxy with encryption

     rev- proxy:   decides what to ans/ not ans || works as  a load balancer.


      CDNs (like Cloudflare) use reverse proxies to prevent DDoS attacks and improve website speed.
